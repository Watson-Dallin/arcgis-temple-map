# Overview

I made this site to practice and learn mapping software.

I was inspired to make this list after reading an article that President Russel M. Nelson, President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has announced a staggering 83 (As of October 2021) temples since becoming President in 2018. There are 265 temples total (including those announced by President Nelson that have yet to be built). That means he has announced over 30% of ALL temples of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

I wanted to learn mapping software as well as celebrate the announcement of so many temples. You may not know much about temples, but many of these beautiful buildings are going to be built in Africa, South America, and the islands of the sea where believers have been praying for access to them for decades.

# Development Environment

I wrote implemented this program using an ArcGIS API, JavaScript, and HTML. I used Visual Studio Code as my editor.

# Useful Websites

* [ArcGIS Official Documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/tutorials/)
* [The Church News | List of all temples announced by President Nelson](https://www.thechurchnews.com/temples/2021-10-03/all-temples-announced-by-president-nelson-228547)

# Future Work

* Filtering by Announcement Date
* Filtering by Continent
* Heatmap of Membership data to see how many people each temple potentially serves. (Not sure if this is publicly available data)
